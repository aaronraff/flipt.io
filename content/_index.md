## A Modern Feature Flag Solution

Flipt is an on-prem feature flag application that allows you to run experiments across services in **your** environment.

Flipt can be deployed within your existing infrastructure so that you don't have to worry about your information being sent to a third party or the latency required to communicate across the internet.

## Multiple Use Cases

With Flipt you can use feature flags in your services in many different ways, including:

* Simple on/off flags to toggle functionality in your applications
* Rollout features to a subset of your audience over time
* Advanced segmentation to target users based on custom properties

## Easily Integrate into Existing Code

Flipt comes with a client [REST API](/docs/api) as well as support for native GRPC clients in a multitude of programming languages including:

Go, Ruby, Java, Python, Javascript and more...
