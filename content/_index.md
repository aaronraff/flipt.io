## Flipt: A Modern Feature Flag System

{{< figure src="/img/flipt.png" alt="Flipt" >}}

Flipt is an on-prem feature flag application that allows you to run experiments across services in **your** environment.

Flipt can be deployed within your existing infrastructure so that you don't have to worry about your information being sent to a third party or the latency required to communicate across the internet.
